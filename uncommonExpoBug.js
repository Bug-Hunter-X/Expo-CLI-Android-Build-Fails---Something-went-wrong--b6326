This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The error message is not very helpful, it just says `Something went wrong.`, and the build fails without any clear indication of what the problem is. This is particularly frustrating for developers who have followed all the instructions in the Expo documentation but still encounter this issue. The issue seems to stem from a problem with the Android build system rather than the code itself. It's hard to debug because there's no detailed error message. Different projects may encounter this in different ways, making it difficult to find a universal solution.
