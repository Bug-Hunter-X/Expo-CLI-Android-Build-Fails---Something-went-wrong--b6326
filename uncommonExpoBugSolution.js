// Several potential workarounds for the "Something went wrong" Expo Android build error.

// 1. Cleaning the build cache:
//   - Run `eas build --platform android --clear`
//   - Manually delete the Android build folders (usually found in the .expo directory)

// 2. Checking Android environment variables:
//   - Ensure that ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME are set correctly in your environment.
//   - Make sure you have the latest Android SDK build-tools installed.

// 3. Reviewing project dependencies (package.json):
//   - Ensure package dependencies do not have version conflicts
//   - Check for updates of packages which might fix the conflict
//   - Try using a lock file for version management (yarn.lock or package-lock.json)

// 4. Creating a new project (as last resort):
//   - If all else fails, creating a new Expo project and carefully migrating your code can sometimes resolve the issue.
