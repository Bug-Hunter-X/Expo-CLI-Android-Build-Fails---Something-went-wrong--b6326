# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: "Something went wrong"

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI.  The error message provides little to no useful information, halting the build process unexpectedly.

## Problem

The Expo CLI's `eas build --platform android` command fails without detailed error logs. The only output is the generic message: `Something went wrong.`  This lack of specificity makes debugging extremely challenging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions (if any) in the `uncommonExpoBug.js` file.
3. Attempt to build the Android APK using `eas build --platform android`.
4. Observe the generic error message: `Something went wrong.`

## Solution (Potential Workarounds)

This issue's root cause often lies within the intricacies of the Android build system, and it's not consistently reproducible.  Several potential workarounds are explored in `uncommonExpoBugSolution.js` including:

* **Cleaning the build cache:**  Sometimes a corrupted cache can cause this error.  The solution file explores methods to clear the cache.
* **Checking Android environment:** Ensure the Android SDK and build tools are properly configured and updated.
* **Reviewing project dependencies:**  Inconsistent or conflicting versions can lead to unexpected build errors.
* **Creating a new project:** In some cases, starting a fresh Expo project may resolve the problem.

## Note

This issue is not always reproducible and may vary depending on your specific project setup and environment. The solutions provided are potential workarounds rather than guaranteed fixes.
